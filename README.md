# 📧 Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Spam Mail Prediction** project! 🚀 This repository contains the code and resources needed to build a machine-learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or not spam. 💌❌

## 🌟 Features

- 📊 **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the email dataset.
- 🧠 **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models.
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models.
- 📬 **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict spam emails.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharathkum05/Spam_Mail_Detection_using_machine_learning.git
   cd Spam_Mail_Detection_using_machine_learning.git
2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 📁 Dataset

Make sure you have the dataset in the `data` directory. If you don't have a dataset, you can download one from popular sources like Kaggle. Place the dataset file (e.g., `spam.csv`) in the `data` folder.

## 🚀 Usage

### Data Preprocessing:

Run the script to preprocess the data.

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

## 🚀 Train the Model

Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.

```bash
python src/train.py
```
